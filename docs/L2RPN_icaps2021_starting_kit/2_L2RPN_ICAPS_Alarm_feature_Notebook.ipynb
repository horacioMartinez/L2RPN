    "**Why an Alarm Feature?**\n",
    "The main motivation of this competition is developing a robust reinforcement learning agent which a) can operate a power grid avoiding potential black out situations and b) capable of generating alarms to inform the human operators that the stiuation is out of its control. The environment considered is an uncertain indeed and also adversarial attacks are presenr to oppose the agent in achieving its goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from providing timely corrective actions, it is intended that a good agent can raise an alarm at the appropriate instant. By 'appropriate instant' we mean that it should not be too far or too close from actual game-over (black out) conditions. If the agent generates an alarm close to potential failure, the remaining time may not be sufficient enough for the human operators to take decision and avert the failure. Also, it is not good to send spurious/false alarm to the operators when there is no threat to the grid operations. There may happen some other condition when an agent raises an alarm considering a failure is inevitable, but due to uncertainties of the environments the acutal failure is not occured. Hence, it is always a challenging task to design an agent which simultaneously make corrective actions and raise alarms in an uncertain environment. It is also important to note that the agent has a limited budget for this alarm feature, that means the no. of alarm can be raised is limited in a fixed duration. For more details, please visit Grid2op documentation."
