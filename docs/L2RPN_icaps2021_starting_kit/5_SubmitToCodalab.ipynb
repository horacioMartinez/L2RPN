    "It is **important that you test your submission files before submitting them**. All you have to do to make a submission is create or modify the `make_agent` and `reward` variables exported in the `__init__.py` script as seen earlier. Then make sure that everything works fine with the following test script. This is the actual program that will run on the server to test your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB** The training dataset provided in this package is different than the private datasets used on codalab (see the section about the data in the [previous notebook](3_Rules_Data_Score_Agent.ipynb)). It is normal that your agent will have a very different score on codalab than here locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the hidden dataset on which your agent will be evaluated has been carefully picked so as to offer different levels of difficulty, but the provided training dataset has NOT. For that reason, the scores will likely not be similar, even though these two datasets originate from the same statistical distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, on codalab, your agent might timeout if it takes too much time to run. Powergrid need to be operated in real time with relatively hard time constraints (you cannot take more than 5 minutes to take an action each 5 minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two cells will test that everything is working correctly and that the submission can be sent. That process will run the agent on a small portion of the training dataset. **It will also generate the zip file that you will have to upload to Codalab.**"
